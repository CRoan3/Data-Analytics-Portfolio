# About
This is a repository of some of my data analytics projects. It contains mostly R code and visualizations posted on Kaggle, as well as dashboards and other visualizations created via Tableau. Please feel free to take a peak, and any feedback is welcome!

Hello! My name is Chris. I started my working career as a personal trainer. I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Kinesiology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and even ventured into physical therapy. I discovered that that was not the course I wanted to take, so I began to look elsewhere. I stumbled upon Google's Data Analytics Certificate program on Coursera over a year ago, and the rest is history. Since, I have continued developing my skillset as a data analyst through taking more courses and working on personal projects. My goal is to begin work as a data analyst and grow with a commpany.

## Projects in R

### Cyclistic Case Study - Google Data Analytics Certificate Project

Code: https://www.kaggle.com/code/chrisroan/cyclistic-case-study-google-da-cert

PowerPoint: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ppuq2hSXsEXMqJbc6FNVe5vm1BWdjreJiAj2yrpovMo/edit#slide=id.p

Description: My goal for this project was to determine some of the key differences in how members and casual users use the Chicago-based Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share service. In this scenario, it is given that members make up the bulk of the revenue for the fictional company, and thus my task is to analyze the differences between the two types of users to provide some insight into how the company can convert casual users into members. All data was collected from Q2 2019 - Q1 2020.
